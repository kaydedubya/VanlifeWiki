Wed notes;
* Fix search bar / category explorer (fixed, needs formatting)
* Implement skeleton structure
* Brainstorm unified article upload


Theoretical skeleton structure

Home -
 \- Primary category links
    \- /pages/singlepage


-=* Accessibility goals *=-
Pictures have labels
Clean backend text that is easy to put through speech-to-text or other such programs

Standard web accessibility concerns
- visual (color blind, low vision, blindness)
  * Label all images
  * Simple & clean format, black & white for maximum contrast, "dark mode" support
  * https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/
- motor (muscle control, tremors)
  * Interactive parts of website should be non-obtrussive and easy to use (eg toggles)
  * Special care should be given to mobile users (touch screen exacerbates usability concerns)
- cognitive (try to unify a simple "in plain english" format for readability)
  * https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Simple_English_Wikipedia#Simple_English
  * https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_difficulty#Readability_predictions
  * Navigation should be clean and intuitive. A link from a category to a page should have an inverse link from a page to a category (eg "this is part of the X series of pages)

Potential nonissues
- auditory (should be a non-issue as this is mostly text)
- seizures (shouldn't have to be said but no strobe or flashing is needed)
